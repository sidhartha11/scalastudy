### Graphs
This is from the book, Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne in which a java application for processing graphs is exposed. I am trying to create a Scala version of the graph processing algorithm presented. 
I am using a Map<ID, MAP> type of structure to implement it.
